/**
 * Core AAP message pump.

 * Owns two [HandlerThread]s:
 * - **Send** (`AapTransport:Handler::Send`) — encrypts and delivers outbound messages.
 * - **Poll** (`AapTransport:Handler::Poll`) — reads, decrypts, and dispatches inbound messages.
 *
 * Lifecycle: [startHandshake] → [startReading] → message loop → [stop]/[quit].
 *
 * @param audioDecoder Decodes PCM audio received from the phone.
 * @param videoDecoder Decodes H.264/H.265 video received from the phone.
 * @param audioManager Used to request and release audio focus.
 * @param settings User preferences (SSL mode, key mappings, microphone sample rate, …).
 * @param notification Background notification handle; updated as connection state changes.
 * @param context Application context; used for broadcasts and system services.
 * @param onAaMediaMetadata Optional callback when the phone sends media metadata (now-playing).
 * @param onAaPlaybackStatus Optional callback when the phone sends playback status/position.
 * @param externalSsl Optional singleton [AapSslContext] whose internal [javax.net.ssl.SSLContext]
 *   (and its `ClientSessionContext` session cache) survives across [AapTransport] recreations.
 *   When provided, JSSE can resume the previous TLS session on reconnect, skipping 4–6
 *   round-trips and saving 1–3 s of handshake time. Pass `null` to create a fresh
 *   [AapSslContext] per transport (no session resumption).
