/**
 * Whether the TCP server the phone is told to dial should be started, left alone, or rebuilt.
 *
 * The server is one object held in a field, and the bind happens asynchronously inside a coroutine
 * it launches. That split is where the bug lives: a bind that throws, or an accept loop that exits,
 * leaves the object assigned to the field with its listening flag false. The old guard was
 * `if (wirelessServer != null) return`, which reads that as "already running" and returns. Nothing
 * rebinds after that, and the only thing that clears the field is a full mode re-initialisation.
 *
 * What the user sees is the whole of the failure: the head unit hosts its network, wakes the phone
 * over Bluetooth, hands out credentials, and the phone joins and finds nothing on the port. The
 * handshake aborts, the phone is woken again seconds later, and it repeats until someone changes a
 * setting.
 *
 * So "assigned" and "working" have to be separate questions, and the answer to a dead server has to
 * be a rebuild. The rebuild then needs a bound, because the caller is a handshake that retries about
 * every four seconds: without one, a port that cannot be bound at all turns into a rebuild loop that
 * is worse than the stall it replaces.
