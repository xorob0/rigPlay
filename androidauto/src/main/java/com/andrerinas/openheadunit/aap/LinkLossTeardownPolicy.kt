 * it back. A session that closes properly does not do that — which is the difference between a
 * drive that ends with the app disconnecting and one that ends with the power being cut.
 *

 * restarting, a power cut with no orderly shutdown). We can help the ones the system tells us about
 * first, and this decides which of those apply to the session actually running.
