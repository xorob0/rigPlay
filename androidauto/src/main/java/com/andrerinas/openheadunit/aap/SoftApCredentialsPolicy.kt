 * hotspot auto-enable exists to fix; "there is one and this device will not name it" is a dead end
 * that polling only hides. They were one boolean once, and on a locked-down unit the resolve loop
 * spent its entire budget re-reading a configuration the device had already refused — logging the
 * same line once a second, switching on an access point that was already up, and never reaching the
 * handshake's first message. From the car that looks like Bluetooth connecting and nothing else
 * happening.
 *
 * Pure so it can be tested at all: the device this matters on is not the device available to test
 * with, so the outcome table pinned in `SoftApCredentialsPolicyTest` is the only place the
 * behaviour is checked.
