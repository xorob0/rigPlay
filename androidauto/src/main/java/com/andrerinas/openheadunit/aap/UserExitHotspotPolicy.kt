/**
 * Whether ending a session by hand should also take down the access point the phone is sitting on.
 *
 * Closing the AAP socket and sending a `ByeByeRequest` does not make the phone leave the network:
 * it stays associated and Android Auto spins on its wireless-setup restart until it throttles
 * itself, because from its side the car walked away mid-session. The only lever this app has is
 * making the network go away — which is exactly what [AapService] already does for WiFi Direct by
 * removing the P2P group. This decides the same question for the two routes that run on a soft AP
 * instead, and is the deliberate complement of [WifiModePolicy.usesWifiDirect]: for any one
 * disconnect exactly one of the two can answer yes.
 *
 * The gate is ownership rather than symptom. A P2P group is always ours, created for the session
 * and safe to remove; a soft AP usually is not — the user switched it on, and switching one back on
 * is best effort that most unrooted units cannot do at all. Leaving somebody's hotspot off with no
 * way to restore it is worse than the stall, which they can clear themselves. So the access point
 * comes down only when they have already handed the app that job.
