/**
 * Which of the several deliveries of one physical button press actually reaches Android Auto.
 *
 * A single press arrives at `CommManager.sendKey` more than once: during projection the OEM hands
 * the foreground activity a raw `KeyEvent` *and* broadcasts a media button, and the car-key
 * receivers add their own copies on top. Every extra delivery that gets through is an extra action
 * on the phone.
 *
 * The discriminator is the event's own identity. `KeyEvent.getDownTime()` is stamped when the
 * gesture began, so every redelivery of one press carries the same value and two real presses never
 * do — which is exact, needs no tuning, and lets a deliberate fast double-press through. The
 * time window survives only for the proprietary OEM broadcasts that carry no `KeyEvent` at all;
 * there, guessing from elapsed time is still all there is.
 *
 * Deciding a press means deciding the whole click, both edges. Releasing a key we never pressed is
 * as wrong as pressing it twice: Android Auto reads a stray release as the end of a gesture it does
 * not have, and a press whose release goes missing leaves the key held down forever.
 *
 * Pure and unit-tested; `CommManager` holds the per-key state and does the sending.
