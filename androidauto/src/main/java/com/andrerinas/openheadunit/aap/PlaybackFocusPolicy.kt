/**
 * Whether to take system audio focus away from other players on the head unit, for both routes that
 * do it: [shouldAcquire] for the dynamic path, which holds focus while an AA audio channel plays,
 * and [shouldAcquirePermanent] for static mode, which holds it for the whole session.
 *
 * Taking focus exists so a *local* player — typically the car's FM radio — pauses while AA audio
 * plays and resumes when it stops. It backfires when the other player is the head unit's Bluetooth
 * A2DP sink: AOSP's `A2dpSinkStreamHandler` answers the focus loss with an AVRCP passthrough PAUSE
 * to the source device, and that source is the very phone feeding the AA stream. On the dynamic
 * path the phone pauses, Android Auto tears the audio sink down, we release focus, the phone
 * resumes, and the whole thing repeats every few seconds. Nothing in the focus API distinguishes
 * the two cases, so this decides it from context instead.
 *
 * The two entry points are exact complements on the `staticAudioFocus` axis: whichever route is
 * live, the other declines, so they can never both hold focus. A test asserts it.
 *
 * Pure and unit-tested; the I/O and the runtime bookkeeping live in [AapAudio] and [AapService].
