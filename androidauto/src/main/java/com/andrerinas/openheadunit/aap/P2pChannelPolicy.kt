/**
 * Whether the channel a P2P group came up on is one a phone can actually join.
 *
 * Android picks the group owner's operating channel itself; below API 29 there is no way to ask for
 * one. On a device whose WiFi country code is unset or permissive the driver can pick 2.4 GHz
 * channel 12 or 13, which most phones will refuse - a client in the FCC domain is limited to
 * channels 1-11 and generally will not even list an access point above that in a scan. The result
 * is a group that is up and beaconing while the phone reports only that it cannot find the network.
 *
 * This only names the condition; nothing acts on it beyond telling the user. The channel is settled
 * when the WiFi radio initialises, not when the group is created, so recreating the group re-picks
 * the same one - measured on a unit where this failed as six recreates all landing on 2467 MHz.
 * Restarting WiFi, or a country code the driver honours, is what moves it.
