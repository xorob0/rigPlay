# Credits and license notices

## Receiver

DiPlay is a modified version of [xcertplay by shilapi](https://github.com/shilapi/xcertplay). The upstream receiver is licensed under GNU GPL version 3; the full text is in `LICENSE` and the original README is retained in `docs/UPSTREAM-README.md`.

Upstream credits [LIVI](https://github.com/f-io/LIVI) and [Showcase](https://github.com/amineross/showcase) for protocol research. Existing source comments and attribution are preserved.

## Home and settings UI

`common/src/main/java/com/shilapi/xcertplay/DiPlayActivity.kt` adapts the palette, visual arrangement and interface copy of the [DiAuto project](https://github.com/shihabal3amri/DiAuto). DiAuto's source is licensed under AGPL version 3. The UI file is marked AGPL-3.0-only; its license text is included in `docs/licenses/DiAuto-AGPL-3.0.txt`.

## CarPlay icon

The unmodified icon was obtained from Apple's developer site at:

CarPlay and the CarPlay icon are Apple Inc. marks/assets. This asset is not covered by the project's open-source code license. Its use here does not imply Apple approval or certification.

## Experimental authentication data

The public preview APK includes an accessory certificate/key pair recovered from public Carlinkit C2Air Allwinner V821 firmware during the owner's local investigation. These data are not newly generated Apple-issued credentials for DiPlay and are not relicensed as project source code. They are bundled in the preview APK to reproduce the offline experiment; continued acceptance and suitability for general distribution are unresolved. The source archive does not contain the private key, and the separate Android APK-signing key is never distributed.

## Android Auto receiver

`androidauto/` is the Android Auto receiver of [DiAuto](https://github.com/shihabal3amri/DiAuto) 0.3.11, an independent fork of [Open Headunit](https://github.com/andreknieriem/open-headunit) and of [headunit](https://github.com/mikereidis/headunit) by Michael Reid, vendored as a library module with the small patches listed in `androidauto/VENDORED.md`. It is licensed under AGPL version 3 (`androidauto/LICENSE`); GPLv3 §13 permits combining it with this GPL-3.0 project, and the AGPL terms continue to apply to that module. It adds Conscrypt (Apache 2.0), protobuf-java (BSD-3), Google Play Services Nearby (Google Play Services terms), Glide (BSD/MIT/Apache 2.0), ZXing (Apache 2.0), dexmaker (Apache 2.0), Shizuku API (Apache 2.0), libsu (Apache 2.0) and the FFmpeg arm64 libraries shipped by DiAuto (LGPL 2.1+; see DiAuto's `docs/THIRD_PARTY.md`). The Android Auto head-unit TLS private key is not distributed with this source. Android Auto is a Google trademark.

## Download website

The static site layout, CSS and generator adapt DiAuto (AGPL-3.0). The AGPL license text is included with the source.

## BYD HUD maneuver icons

Required Notice: Copyright AndyShaman (https://github.com/AndyShaman/BYDMate)

The maneuver PNGs under `shared/src/main/assets/byd-hud-icons` were imported from BYDMate. Its PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0 terms and required notice are included alongside the assets. These files are separate from the project code license; upstream describes them as donor assets and their original provenance is not independently established. The validated DiLink5.1 windshield path uses factory turn codes rather than these images.
