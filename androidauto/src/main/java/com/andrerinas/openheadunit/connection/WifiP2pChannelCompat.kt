/**
 * Reaches `WifiP2pManager.setWifiP2pChannels`, which is hidden on every API level but is the only way
 * a pre-Android-10 device can be told which frequency to host its group on.
 *
 * The same reflection shape as `setDeviceName` in [WifiDirectManager], for the same reason: the
 * method is `@hide` rather than absent, and the non-SDK blocklist that would refuse it only starts at
 * API 28, below which this is the only lever there is. See [P2pOperatingChannelPolicy] for what the
 * platform does with the value and why the listen channel must be left alone.
 *
 * Every failure here is non-fatal by construction. A group on the platform's own choice of channel is
 * the behaviour that shipped; a group that never forms because a reflection threw is not, so the
 * caller is told and carries on either way.
