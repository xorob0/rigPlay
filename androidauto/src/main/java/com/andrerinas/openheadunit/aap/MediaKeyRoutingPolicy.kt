/**
 * Whether a physical media button should be forwarded to Android Auto, or left to the Bluetooth
 * side that may already be acting on the same press.
 *
 * A head unit can end up with two consumers for one button. The OEM key handler delivers the press
 * to us *and* the Bluetooth media stack acts on it independently: AOSP's
 * `BluetoothMediaBrowserService` publishes a real media session whose skip-to-next issues an AVRCP
 * passthrough FORWARD to the source device — the same phone that is projecting to us. Both
 * consumers reach the same media app, so one press skips two tracks.
 *
 * Only the cumulative commands show it. Play/pause is a state-specific passthrough (PLAY or PAUSE
 * depending on the sink's own playback state), so two consumers converge on one result and the user
 * sees nothing wrong; next/previous add up. That asymmetry is the fingerprint of this failure, and
 * it is what rules out "the key is sent twice" faults inside this app, which would double both.
 *
 * Nothing in the platform arbitrates the two: the Bluetooth profile calls that would deactivate the
 * other consumer are `BLUETOOTH_PRIVILEGED`, aborting the broadcast does not work because the
 * framework's media-button route is single-target rather than an ordered fan-out, and taking audio
 * focus to deactivate the sink's session is exactly the behaviour [PlaybackFocusPolicy] exists to
 * avoid. So the lever is which consumer *we* leave the key to.
 *
 * Pure and unit-tested; the Bluetooth probe and the send live in `CommManager`.
