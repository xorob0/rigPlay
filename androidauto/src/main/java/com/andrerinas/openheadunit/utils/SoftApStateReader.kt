 * Asks the framework whether this device is running an access point.
 *
 * `WifiManager.getWifiApState()` is the soft-AP counterpart to the public `getWifiState()`, but it
 * is not public API, so it is reached by reflection and its constants are written out here. On
 * devices where the non-SDK interface restrictions block it the call throws, which is reported as
 * [SoftApState.UNKNOWN] rather than as "no access point" — a question we could not ask is not a
 * question answered no, and callers treat the two very differently.
