     * API disconnects a client from your own access point, and the one thing that comes close,
     * `SoftApConfiguration`'s blocked-client list, needs the same `setSoftApConfiguration()` call
     * that head units routinely refuse outright. So the network has to go; it does not have to stay
     * gone. Bringing it back here costs seconds nobody is waiting through, where leaving it down
     * charges the same seconds to the next connection, with the phone waiting.
     *
     * Putting it back is the part that is not free, and it is asked for **once** — measured rather
     * than assumed. Tearing an access point down and asking for it again is the sequence some
     * drivers handle worst: hostapd begins its channel scan before the interface is back, the scan
     * returns `ENODEV`, and it aborts instead of starting. Asking again at this layer does not beat
     * that. Across three runs, **nine** asks spaced ~12.5 s apart failed with that same signature
     * and not one recovered; the single bring-up that did succeed came from a start posted **127 ms**
     * behind a failed one — 270 ms in an earlier capture — landing in a window open for a few hundred
     * milliseconds and shut long before this layer can ask again. Where the hardware handles a
     * stop/start cleanly one ask is all that was ever needed; where it does not, the access point
     * stays down and the next connection's auto-enable brings it back, which is the cost this
     * restart exists to avoid, paid only on hardware that will not cooperate — rather than that same
     * cost plus half a minute of asking that never works.
     *
     * There is also a window this cannot close. Between the two calls the access point is genuinely
     * down, and a process killed outright in that window — `am force-stop`, or the system reclaiming
     * the app — runs none of the code below, so the hotspot stays off. Measured, and bounded rather
     * than fixed: the next connection's `SoftApCredentialsProvider` auto-enable switches it back on,
     * which is the same cost the restart exists to avoid paying, not a permanent break. Shrinking
     * [RESTART_SETTLE_MS] narrows the window; nothing removes it.
