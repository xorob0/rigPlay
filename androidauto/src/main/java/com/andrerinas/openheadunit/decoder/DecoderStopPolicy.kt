/**
 * Decides whether a [VideoDecoder.stop] call ends the projection session or only tears the decoder
 * down while the phone keeps streaming.
 *
 * The distinction matters because some of the decoder's state describes the *stream* rather than
 * the decoder instance - the pinned codec type above all - and throwing it away while the stream is
 * still running forces a re-detection on whatever mid-stream packet happens to arrive next. That
 * heuristic cannot tell an ordinary H.264 P-slice header (0x41) from an HEVC VPS, so the re-detect
 * can hand an H.264 stream an HEVC decoder.
 *
 * Anything not listed here ends the session, so an unrecognised reason keeps the old behaviour of
 * resetting everything.
