 * Central connection and transport lifecycle manager.

 * CommManager owns the full lifecycle of both the physical connection ([AccessoryConnection])
 * and the AAP protocol layer ([AapTransport]). It exposes a single [connectionState] flow as
 * the source of truth; all consumers (AapService, AapProjectionActivity, UI fragments) observe
 * this flow reactively instead of being called imperatively.
