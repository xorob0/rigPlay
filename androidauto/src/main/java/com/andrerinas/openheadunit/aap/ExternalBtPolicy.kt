/**
 * Whether this head unit's Bluetooth is an *external module* — a separate chip on a serial link,
 * driven by the vendor's own daemon — rather than the radio behind `android.bluetooth`.
 *
 * The four signals are the ones the reference head unit software uses to decide the same thing,
 * and they were confirmed against a unit whose own vendor log reports `bttype:extra` while its
 * Bluetooth module answers to a different name (`CAR8032`) and a different MAC than the Android
 * adapter reports. On that unit the vendor software routes Android Auto entirely through the
 * external module and never opens an RFCOMM server on the Android radio.
 *
 * These signals are a marker for that class of hardware, not a diagnosis of a specific fault. What
 * is measured on the one such unit examined closely: the phone opens an RFCOMM channel to the
 * Android radio, flow control stays open, and the radio then transmits no payload at all — writes
 * succeed, `flush()` returns, the log looks healthy, and not one byte goes on the air. Whether
 * every unit carrying these signals fails the same way is not established; what is established is
 * that the vendor does not use this path on them, so it is not a path to recommend.
