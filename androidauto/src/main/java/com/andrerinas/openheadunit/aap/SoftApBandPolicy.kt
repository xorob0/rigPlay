 * and the projection then dies within seconds — a failure mode that reads as "Android Auto starts
 * and drops" and has cost several rounds of log-reading to recognise. The reference head unit
 * software running this route on the same class of hardware brings its AP up on channel 36, and
 * the AA protocol itself carries the phone's answer to the same question (`selected_wifi_channel
 * _type`, one of 2.4-only / 5-only / dual).
 *
 * 2.4 GHz is kept only as a fallback for radios with no 5 GHz support at all, where the choice is
 * between a shaky link and none.
