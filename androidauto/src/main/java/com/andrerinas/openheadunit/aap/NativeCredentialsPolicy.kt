 * Whether a set of credentials is fit to hand the phone. The interesting case is a missing BSSID,
 * where the answer differs by transport:
 *
 * - **WiFi Direct** aborts. Measured, not cautious: a masked BSSID there means the phone rejects
 *   the credentials anyway, and the usual cause (location services off) is fixable once the log
 *   says so rather than showing a healthy-looking handshake and a phone that never arrives.
 * - **Hotspot** sends anyway, with the field empty. Not because an empty one works — it does not —
 *   but because the phone's refusal is a message we can explain, where aborting leaves nothing to
 *   read, and because the route stays open for any client that is less strict than the one measured.
 *
 * The justification this used to carry — that aa-proxy-rs and ZLink ship without a BSSID, so an
 * ordinary AP is identified by SSID — was wrong, and it is worth recording how wrong. Both reference
 * implementations declare `required string bssid = 3` in a byte-identical proto2 schema, and both
 * read it from the access point's own interface: aa-proxy-rs takes `mac_address_by_name(iface)` and
 * **fails to start** with "No MAC address found" if it cannot, and WirelessAndroidAutoDongle
 * defaults it to `getMacAddress("wlan0")`. Neither has a no-BSSID mode. The one aa-proxy-rs path
 * that has no address to hand sets an empty string, precisely because `required` forbids dropping
 * the field, with a comment anticipating that phones may need a real one.
 *
 * The phone side agrees. A current Gearhead joins with a `WifiNetworkSpecifier`, which matches SSID
 * *and* BSSID under a full `ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff` mask: credentials with no BSSID drew
 * `WIFI_INVALID_BSSID` and a type 6 `status=-3` on every attempt, with no fallback to matching on
 * the name. Measured 2026-08-05, phone-to-phone.
 *
 * So a missing BSSID is a failure everywhere it has been looked at, and the static BSSID setting is
 * the fix rather than a workaround. What this policy still buys is the *shape* of the failure: one
 * explained refusal instead of a silent abort.

     * - [interfaceNamedByUser] never refuses. Naming the interface is a specific claim about which
     *   network is up, and it is the escape hatch for a vendor that starts hostapd outside the
     *   framework — where the state read is silent while the access point is plainly there.
     *
     * A hand-typed *SSID* is deliberately not an exemption, though it was once: it names a network,
     * not an interface, and it is required on any device that refuses the config-read API — so
     * exempting it disabled this check on exactly the hardware that needed it.
